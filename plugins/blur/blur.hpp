 * The design of blur takes extra consideration due to the fact that
 * the results of blurred pixels rely on surrounding pixel values.
 * This means that when damage happens for only part of the scene (1),
 * blurring this area can result to artifacts because of sampling
 * beyond the edges of the area. To work around this issue, wayfire
 * issues two signals - workspace-stream-pre and workspace-stream-post.
 * workspace-stream-pre gives plugins an opportunity to pad the rects
 * of the damage region (2) and save a snap-shot of the padded area from
 * the buffer containing the last frame. This will be used to redraw
 * the area that will contain artifacts after rendering. This is ok
 * because this area is outside of the original damage area, so the
 * pixels wont be changing in this region of the scene. pre_render is
 * called with the padded damage region as an argument (2). The padded
 * damage extents (3) are used for blitting from the framebuffer, which
 * contains the scene rendered up until the view for which pre_render
 * is called. The padded damage extents rect is blurred with artifacts
 * in pre_render, after which it is then alpha blended with the window
 * and rendered to the framebuffer. Finally, workspace-stream-post
 * allows a chance to redraw the padded area with the saved pixels,
 * before swapping buffers. As long as the padding is enough to cover
 * the maximum sample offset that the shader uses, there should be a
 * seamless experience.
